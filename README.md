# Printf
## Project overview

This project aimed at recoding the printf function from the C Standard library to be reused in my future projects. This is the first challenging project where I had to code a complex fucntion from scratch.

## What I learned

1. Thought through Program architecture.
2. Code organisation and segmentation.
3. Basic TDD (Test Driven Development).
4. Advanced debugging.
